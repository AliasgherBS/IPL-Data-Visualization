#IPL-Data-Visualization


This is a data science project mainly focussing on visualization of data with advanced methadologies such as Knowledge Graphs or ontologies to better understand the scope of data. The tasks involved a dataset for the IPL 2008 cricket tournament.


The project mainly revolves around answering the following questions:


Q1) In what context or for whom the performance is being measured?

Q2) What are the objectives or why the performance is being measured?

Q3) Is the measured performance aligning with the objectives?

Q4) How is the performance measured?

Q5) How can we validate our measured performance?

Q6) Whatâ€™s the most important feature/variable involved while measuring performance?

Q7) What will be the method for calculating performance?

Q8) Does the calculation of performance involves single or multiple features/variables?


All of the questions were answered keeping in mind the data science approach to first observe, then hypothesize, then expriement (visualization) and finally according to the results conclude on a decision.
